  <article class="about">
    Venus, our sister planet, orbits the sun in a smaller orbit than that of Earth. Specifically, while the average Earth-Sun distance is 1 AU (approximately 150 million Km), the average Venus-Sun distance is 0.723 AU. This difference causes Venus to orbit the sun  faster than Earth: while Earth year lasts approximately 365.2 earth days, the Venus year lasts approximately 224.6 earth days (interestingly this is only 0.9 Venus days!). Now, by pure coincidence, the fraction 365.2 / 224.6 is very close to 13 / 8, which means that every 13 Earth years the orbits of Venus and Earth complete one cycle, in which Earth orbits the sun 13 times and Venus 8 times, coming back to the original point. Additionally, Venus approaches Earth 5 times forming a beautiful 5 petal pattern known since ancient times as the <a href="#">Pentagram of Venus</a>. Here, we see a simulation of the 13 year cycle from two viewpoints: one with a fixed Earth in the center and another one with the sun at the center. When the Earth is fixed, Venus draws its trajectory from the Earth viewpoint, when the sun is fixed, the a succession of lines connecting the two plantes is drawn to form the pattern. (What about drawing the trajectory of the middle point of the line connecting the two planets instead?).
